# Rationale

Automating DevOps workflows is difficult because it often involve multiple `executables` like shell/ruby/perl/etc scripts and commands.

Because those executables vary in:

* Their quality; from scripts written in a day, intended as a one-off command, but which wind up sticking around for months or even years, to serious commands which are well-designed and written in richer programming languages with adequate tests.
* Their interface; some passing parameters via environment variables, others having application specific command-line flags, or configuration files.

Writing a single tool which

* wires up all the executables
* re-implements all the things currently done in various tools

is time-consuming.

# Getting Started

Download and install `variant` from the GitHub releases page:

https://github.com/mumoshu/variant/releases

Create a yaml file named `myfirstcmd` containing:

```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env variant

tasks:
  bar:
    script: |
      echo "dude"
  foo:
    parameters:
    - name: bar
      type: string
      description: "the bar"
    - name: environment
      type: string
      default: "heaven"
    script: |
      echo "Hello {{ get "bar" }} you are in the {{ get "environment" }}"
```

Now run your command by:

```console
$ chmod +x ./myfirstcmd
$ ./myfirstcmd
Usage:
  myfirstcmd [command]

Available Commands:
  bar
  env         Print currently selected environment
  foo
  help        Help about any command
  ls          test
  version     Print the version number of this command

Flags:
  -c, --config-file string   Path to config file
  -h, --help                 help for myfirstcmd
      --logtostderr          write log messages to stderr (default true)
  -o, --output string        Output format. One of: json|text|bunyan (default "text")
  -v, --verbose              verbose output

Use "myfirstcmd [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Each task in the `myfirstcmd` is given a sub-command. Run `myfirstcmd foo` to run the task named `foo`:

```console
$ ./myfirstcmd foo
Hello dude you are in the heaven
```

Look at the substring `dude` contained in the output above. The value `dude` is coming from the the parameter `bar` of the task `foo`. As we didn't specify the value for the parameter, `variant` automatically runs the task `bar` to fulfill it.

To confirm that the task `bar` is emitting the value `dude`, try running it:

```console
$ ./myfirstcmd bar
INFO[0000] ≫ sh -c echo "dude"
dude
```

To specify the value, use the corresponding command-line flag automatically created and named after the parameter `bar`:

```console
$ ./myfirstcmd foo --bar=folk
Hello folk you are in the heaven
```

Alternatively, you can source the value from a YAML file.

Create `myfirstcmd.yaml` containing:

```yaml
foo:
  bar: variant
```

Now your task sources `variant` as the value for the parameter:

```console
$ ./myfirstcmd foo
Hello variant you are in the heaven
```

# Releasing a variant-made command

While Variant makes it easy for you to develop a modern CLI without recompiling,
it is able to produce a single executable binary of your command.

Example: [examples/hello](https://github.com/mumoshu/variant/tree/master/examples/hello)

Write a small shell script that wraps your variant command into a simple golang program:

```console
$ cat <<EOF > main.go
package main
import "github.com/mumoshu/variant/pkg/run"
func main() {
    run.YAML(\`
$(cat yourcmd)
\`)
}
EOF

$ cat <<EOF > Gopkg.toml
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/mumoshu/variant"
  version = "v0.24.0"
EOF
```

And then build with the standard golang toolchain:

```console
$ dep ensure
$ go build -o dist/yourcmd .
```

```console
$ ./mycli --target variant
Hello variant!
```

It is recommended to version-control the produced `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` because it is just more straight-forward than managing embedded version of em in the shell snippet.

It is NOT recommended to version-control `main.go`. One of the benefits of Variant is you don't need to recompile while developing. So it is your Variant command written in YAML that should be version-controlled, rather than `main.go` which is necessary only while releasing.

# How it works

Variant is a framework to build a CLI application which becomes the single entry point to your DevOps workflows.

It consists of:

* YAML-based DSL
  * to define a CLI app's commands, inputs
  * which allows splitting commands into separate source files, decoupled from each others
* Ways to configure your apps written using Variant via:
  * defaults
  * environment variables
  * command-line parameters
  * application specific configuration files
  * environment specific configuration files
* DI container
  * to implicitly inject required inputs to a commands from configuration files or outputs from another commands
  * to explicit inject inputs to commands and its dependencies via command-line parameters

# Features

- Task grouping
- Dependency injection

## Dependency injection

An input named `myinput` for the task `mytask` can be one of follows, in order of precedence:

* Value of the command-line option `--myinput`
* Value of the configuration variable `mytask.myinput`
  * from the environment specific config file: `config/environments/<environment name>.yaml`
  * from the common config file: `<command name>.yaml`(normally `var.yaml`)
* Output of the task `myinput`

## Environments

You can switch `environment` (or context) in which a task is executed by running `var env set <env name>`.

```
$ var env set dev
$ var test
#=> reads inputs from var.yaml + config/environments/dev.yaml

$ var env set prod
$ var test
#=> reads inputs from var.yaml + config/environments/prod.yaml
```

# Future Goals

* Runners to run tasks in places other than the host running your Variant app
  * Docker
  * Kubernetes
  * etc
* Tools/instructions to package your Variant app for easier distribution
  * Single docker image containing
    * all the scripts written directly in the yaml
    * maybe all the scripts referenced from scripts in the yaml
    * maybe all the commands run via the host runner
* Integration with job queues
  * to ensure your tasks are run reliably, at-least-once, tolerating temporary failures
